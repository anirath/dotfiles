## Notes ##
### 2020.05.07 ###
Now that I've managed to pretty much finish the **bash** portion of **dotfiles** based on my existing ones
being used by **anirath** on [rishon@maarekhet][1] I would like to start work on the **install script**.
Obviously, won't be *anywhere* near finishing it soon, but it would be nice to get started on it at least for
the now existing **configs**.
