# WARNING #
###########
This project of mine is just beginning, so expect this **Readme** as well as the rest of the project to be
incomplete. So, I don't recommend following any of this documentation, or even attempting to use any of
these files at all, while I am still developing this project. When things are in a generally functional
state this **Readme** will be updated to remove this warning as well as contain valid and helpful info.

##########
# Readme #
##########
This collection of dotfiles is used in my own config, but is available to the public so anyone who wants to
may use them both privately or commercially. I don't mind at all! All of the actual files can be found in the
various subdirectories under `./src/`. A potential user can either manually pick and choose then install the
files of their choice, or one could simply run the included install script to automatically install their
chosen files.

###########
# Install #
###########
Installing these dotfiles is fairly simple, and there are essentially two different methods for this. But,
before anything your first step will be to download the project.

------------
# Download #
------------
There are three methods for downloading the files:

- Method 1 (Invalid for Now) -- Download one of the releases, and extract the downloaded archive.

- Method 2 -- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/anirath/dotfiles.git anirath_dotfiles`

- Method 3 (Recommended) -- Fork the repository and clone your new fork.

-----------
# Install #
-----------
There are two methods for installing the files:

- Automated Install -- After downloading the files you can run the included install script. The script will
prompt the user through installing the files of their choice, and allows for a limited bit of custom config.

- Manual Install -- If you would like to only use certain files, and you don't want to run the automated
script, you can also browse through the various files contained in `./src/` to find which files you want.
Then, you just have to copy or move the selected files into their particular locations. (You can find the
default expected location for a file in the first couple lines of the code.)
